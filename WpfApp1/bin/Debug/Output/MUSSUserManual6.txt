CHAPTER tt - COMMAND INTERPRETERS

6. l INTRODUCTION

The basic command Interpreter PPC.SEQ merely calls PPC.CMD to process
single commands which specify the name and parameters of any library
procedure. However. it also provides the means by which other more
sophisticated command Interpreters can make interpretive calls on library
procedures. One such command interpreter will be added to issue " of
MUSS which will provide for example

1) control structures

IF THEN ELSE

WHILE

FOR
2) named variables of any type
3) 'wild cardlng' of file names.

it is also possible to compile and run a standard UNIX shell under MUSS
and this is described in Volume 3.
